1. Business logic	
	=> calculations
2. UI (presentation) logic
	=> accepting value from user or printing something to user

SOLID principle:
S => single responsibility
	one class should be used for once purpose. every class has their own purpose
	Calculation => provide methods for calculation
	App => privide methods for user interaction
