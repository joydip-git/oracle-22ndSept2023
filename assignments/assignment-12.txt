Objective: implementation of method reference, functional interface etc.

Create a Java application:
1. create a static method after main() method, which accepts List<Integer> as argument and returns List<Integer>.
purpose of the method is to filter the input List<Integer> and return a new List<Integer> with filtered values
example: use the method to filter only the even numbers from the input list and return a new list with those even numbers only from the method

2. In main() method, create an object of List<Integer> and add some values
3. call the method created in step-1 from main() and pass this list object as argument and print all filtered numbers (such as, even numbers) from the list returned by the method
