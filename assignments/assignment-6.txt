Exception Handling in Banking Application
A very simple banking application should allow account creation, transfer funds between accounts.
While doing these operations many abnormalities may occur and to make your application a ro-bust one is a challenging task.

A. Objective 
Write a hierarchy of custom exception class and to funnel the exceptions. 

B. Problem Statement

Create an Account class that contains the following information: 
Account number, name of account holder and balance.
The Account class should allow the following operations:

1)	Deposit
a.	It should throw InvalidAmountException, if user tries to deposit amount less than or equal to zero.
b.	The balance should get updated if user enters a valid amount

2)	Withdraw
a.	Should update the balance if an valid amount is entered
b.	Should throw InvalidAmountException, if user tries to withdraw amount less than or equal to zero.
c.	Should throw InsufficientBalanceException, if the user tries to withdraw an amount which is greater than existing balance.

3)	Balance inquiry.
a.	Should return the existing balance in the account

Now, create a Bank Service class with following functionalities

1)	Create an Account
a.	On successful creation the account should be stored into a static data.
b.	If account creation fails should throw AccountCreationException.
c.	Reasons why account creation should fail
	i.	Initial amount for account creation is less than 500.
	ii.	Account Number already exists
	iii.	Name not provided

2)	Transfer funds between two accounts
a.	On successful transfer of funds the balance should get updated in both the ac-counts. 
b.	On failure should throw AccountTransactionException
c. Reasons why Transaction fails
	i.	InvalidAmountException
	ii.	InsufficientBalanceException

d.	Need to log all the transaction attempts (i.e, Debit from account, Credit to ac-count and the amount) irrespective of successful transaction or even for failure cases also.

The main application using these two classes should work with the following try, catch 
1)	try { 
// invoke Bank Service code here
} catch(BankingApplicationException exception) { }
The main code should also work for the following try, catch blocks
2)	try {
// invoke Bank Service code here
} catch(AccountCreationException exception) { }
3)	try {
// invoke Bank Service code here
} catch(AccountTransactionException exception) { }
