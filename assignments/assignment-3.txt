create a Java application to calculate salary of any employee

name of the application: PayrollApp

entities:
class: employee
employee entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double/float

child class#1:
Hr entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment, gratuity payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h+g]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double

child class#2:
Developer entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment, incentive payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h+i]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double


UI:
	a. ask user how many employee instances/records to be created
	b. create that many employee instances (accept all the attribute values from user)
		i. print menu for user so that user can choose which type of object to be created
		ii. based on the choice you create that type of employee object (either hr or developer)
	c. save every instance of employee in an array [make sure you adding only unique objects of employee type in the array - just check whether employees do have the same id or not. i.e, in the array only employees with unique id should be allowed to be added]
	d. iterate through the array and calculate salary of every instance and print the same

Note: 
*: the class containing main method and the class for employee types should be present in different packages in the application
**: every data member must have getter and setter.
***: the class must have default and parameterized constructor
****: do not write entire code in main method. create small functions for individual task.
