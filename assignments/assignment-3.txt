create a Java application to calculate salary of any employee

name of the application: PayrollApp

entity:
class: employee
employee entity structure:
	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double/float


UI:
	a. ask user how many employee instances/records to be created
	b. create that many employee instances (accept all the attribute values from user)
	c. save every instance of employee in an array
	d. iterate through the array and calculate salary of every instance and print the same

Note: 
*: the class containing main method and the class for employee type should be present in different packages in the application
**: every data member must have getter and setter.
***: the class must have default and parameterized constructor
****: do not write entire code in main method. create small functions for individual task.
