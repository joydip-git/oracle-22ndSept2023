	attributes: name, id, basic payment, da payment, hra payment
	functionalities: 
		name: 		calculateSalary [b+d+h]
		argumnets: 	none
		return type: 	double


UI:
	a. ask user how many employee instances/records to be created

	c. save every instance of employee in an array
	d. iterate through the array and calculate salary of every instance and print the same

Note:

**: every data member must have getter and setter.
***: the class must have default and parameterized constructor
