Objective: learn how to use functional interface to call methods using their references

Create a Java application: 

1. Create a functional interface with an abstract method which accepts two integer type values as arguments and returns Integer type value
2. Create a class with two methods similar to that of the interface method. One should be instance and another should be static.
3. In main() method use the functional interface, created in step-1 to call those two methods of that class, created in step-2
