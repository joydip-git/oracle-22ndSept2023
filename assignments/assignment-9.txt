Create a Java application to find out every word in a string and its occurrences and display the word and its occurrences in sorted manner (sorted alphabetically by the words)

sample sentence:
Java is a programming language, I use Java for coding in any application.

sample output:
a:1
any:1
application:1
coding:1
for:1
...
Java:2

class <name>{
	public static void main(....){
		//ask user to enter any sentence
		//pass the sentence to getWordsAndCount method
		//print the words and their count from the returned collection
	}

	public <return-type> getWordsAndCount(String sentence){
		//code
		//return collection of words and count for each
	}
}

Now, write unit test cases to check whether the functionality works properly or not
